I am a french informatic engeneer studient who has decided to go to Qu√©bec for his last study year. I decided to do this in order to learn 
a lot in video games development. Indeed, since I discovered that I love informatic sciences, I wanted to learn a lot in all of domains.
This was a great opportunities to go to this foreign University and I learned so much by the culture or the education over there.
